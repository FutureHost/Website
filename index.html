					<h3>I advise everyone to say away from MC-Market Hosts all together. They are sewn with drama and discourse. They all lack proper management and experience to run legitimate hosts. They are all mostly dead on arrival or on their death bed already. This whole experience has shown how to destroy a community from the inside out with a simple message. Words can create and destroy bonds and friendships. The internet is something to only take at face value. A ton of these people, including yourselves, get way to involved in the intricate details of an online community. This is supposed to be fun, but as you can see, it can easily go the other way. Everywhere you go, you see nothing but drama and politics. Each host has their own version of this too. These $1/GB hosts are nothing but trash and false promises. "Service Team Companies" "Hosting Companies" and whatever. A piece of paper that says you paid a fee to become a "registered company" means nothing. I hope you have all learned this by now. From Fallout Host and RX Group, to Skybomb and Enteron, the issues can easily be drawn up into the surface. It is up to you, the consumer, to make your own choices. I leave you with this warning; This community and everything about it is toxic and shameful. We have all partaken into some pretty serious and petty stupid shit. We have also proven the point above. A group of 100+ people have destroyed companies and relationships by simple words. It becomes obvious that these relationships and companies were fragile to begin with. This is all due to one key issue. Management. A simple Trustpilot review and positive reputation means nothing. As a true system administrator, I cry at the excuse these people and companies are. Trash. All of it. Stay educated folks.</h3>
